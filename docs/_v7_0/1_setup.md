The client library is available as a nuget package. The client library (and associated nuget package) is updated regularly as new functionality is added. 


To install the nuget package, follow these steps in Visual Studio:

1. Select _TOOLS -> nuget Package Manager -> Manage nuget Packages Solution..._
1. Search for _digipost-api-client_.
* If you would like pre-releases of this package, make sure _Include Prerelease_ is enabled. Please refer to documentation for your version of Visual Studio for detailed instructions.
1. Select _digipost-api-client_ and click _Install_.


### Install and use business certificate

<blockquote>SSL Certificates are small data files that digitally bind a cryptographic key to an organization's details. When installed on a web server, it activates the padlock and the https protocol (over port 443) and allows secure connections from a web server to a browser.</blockquote>

To communicate over HTTPS you need to sign your request with a business certificate. The business certificate can be loaded directly from file or from the Windows certificate store. The latter is preferred, as this avoids password handling in the code itself.

#### Install business certificate to certificate store
 The following steps will install the certificate in the your certificate store. This should be done on the server where your application will run.

1.  Double-click on the actual certificate file (CertificateName.p12)
1.  Save the sertificate in _Current User_ or _Local Machine_ and click _Next_. If you are running the client library from a system account, but debugging from a different user, please install it on _Local Machine_, as this enables loading it from any user.
1.  Use the suggested filename. Click _Next_
1.  Enter password for private key and select _Mark this key as exportable ..._ Click _Next_
1.  Choose _Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate_
1.  Click _Next_ and _Finish_
1.  Accept the certificate if prompted.
1.  When prompted that the import was successful, click _Ok_

#### Use business certificate thumbprint in code

1. Start mmc.exe (Click windowsbutton and type mmc.exe)
1. _Choose File_ -> _Add/Remove Snap-inâ€¦_ (Ctrl + M)
1. Mark certificate and click _Add >_
1. If the certificate was installed in _Current User_ choose _My User Account_ and if installed on _Local Machine_ choose _Computer Account_. Then click _Finish_ and then _OK_
1. Expand _Certificates_ node, select _Personal_ and open _Certificates_
1. Double-click on the installed certificate
1. Go to the _Details_ tab
1. Scroll down to _Thumbprint_
1. Copy the thumbprint and load as shown below

``` csharp
var config = new ClientConfig(senderId: "xxxxx", environment: Environment.Production);
var client = new DigipostClient(config, thumbprint: "84e492a972b7e...");
```

### Load business certificate from file
If there is a reason for not loading the certificate from the Windows certificate store, you can use the constructor taking in a `X509Certificate2`:

``` csharp
var config = new ClientConfig(senderId: "xxxxx", environment: Environment.Production);
var businessCertificate =
new X509Certificate2(
    @"C:\Path\To\Certificate\Cert.p12",
    "secretPasswordProperlyInstalledAndLoaded",
    X509KeyStorageFlags.Exportable
);

var client = new DigipostClient(config, businessCertificate);

```
